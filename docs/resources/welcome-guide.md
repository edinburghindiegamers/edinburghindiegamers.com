# Welcome Guide

This is a short guide for newcomers on what to expect at an Edinburgh Indie Gamers meet.
It goes over information on the kinds of games we run, the running order of events, and describes the general tone we try to achieve.

We ask that, where possible, people **indicate on Discord whether or not they are attending an event**.
This lets us plan for numbers more accurately.
Given space limitations at the venue, we may have to start capping attendees if it gets too busy.

If you have any questions about the events, feel free to ask one of the organisers and we will help as best we can!

## Abide By the Code of Conduct

We require that all our members read and abide by our Code of Conduct in all of the club's spaces, both online and in-person.
[The Code of Conduct can be found on our website](../code-of-conduct.md).

In order to gain full access to the Discord server, members will have to confirm that they have read and accepted our Code of Conduct.

You can find more information on how to reach us via our [Contact](../contact/index.md) page.

## The Kind of Games We Play

As the name suggests, we are an **Indie Games Club**, and our events are **story games** meetups.

!!! definition "Indie Games"

    These are small press role-playing games, so not the ones that would be published by large commercial publishers.
    There are already a lot of spaces where those kinds of games are predominantly offered, so we spotlight a different selection instead.

If you want to get more into the jargon, then the kinds of games we play include narrative games, Nordic-style games, diceless games, GMful and GMless games, PbTA games, et cetera.
If none of these terms mean anything to you, that’s fine too.
There’s no need to overthink this.

!!! definition "Story Games"

    These are games that are about collaborating to tell a story, as opposed to tactical wargames or the like.
    This is a wide brief, and covers a large number of games.

Some examples of games that have run at the club in the past are *Decaying Orbit*, *Dream Askew*, *For the Queen*, *Good Society*, *Monster of the Week*, and *Wanderhome*.
If you’re still curious, and if you want to see detailed examples of how story games differ from other games, you could look up playthroughs or actual plays of these games on-line.
But if you’re not familiar with this, then that’s okay too.

*We don’t presume any degree of familiarity with tabletop role-playing, indie games, or any specific games.*

Additionally, many members of the club playtest their own games here as well! So you might end up playing something unique devised by a member of the club.

## The Running Order

The event **starts at 6:00 pm**.
Member of the Admin Team will be present at the start of the event to welcome attendees, and will introduce themselves to participants.
Feel free to speak to them over the course of the evening if you need help with anything.

The first half-hour is the arrival time for everyone to get food or drinks or just catch up.
While we don’t start pitches until half-past, it’s a good idea to arrive on time to make sure everything runs smoothly.

As people arrive and as the events get started, members of the admin team will introduce themselves.
If you have any issues, concerns, or questions, feel free to speak to them.

!!! Question "Order of Events"

    **6:00 pm to 6:30 pm**: Arrival Time.  
    **6:30 pm**: Pitches; games start thereafter.  
    **10:00 pm**: Wrap up and close.

During the pitches, people who have brought games to play will pitch the games.
They will give a brief description of the game and how many players they can take.
You can find more information on this in our [guide to facilitating and pitching games](./facilitating-and-pitching.md).

After everyone who has brought a game has pitched, people will be free to join the various games.
We normally give newcomers the first pick of a game of their choice, followed by all returning members.
Once everyone has joined a game, the games can start and facilitators at each table take it from there.

Games will run until shortly before 10 pm to allow everyone time to pack up and tidy.

!!! Tip ""

    You are welcome to leave at any time.
    If a game is not working for you, if you have something else come up, or if you are just not feeling it, it’s fine to leave (even if you are the game’s facilitator).
