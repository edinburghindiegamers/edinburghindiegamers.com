Edinburgh Indie Gamers is an inclusive tabletop gaming club dedicated to indie roleplaying and story games.

!!! question "What is an indie game?"

    We play small-press roleplaying games of the types which let players tell a story together.
    These are games not made by large, mainstream publishing companies.
    If you're not sure what any of this means, that's a sign you need to get stuck in and join us.
    (Don't worry, the water's lovely...)

    For more information on the kinds of games we play, see our [Welcome Guide](resources/welcome-guide.md#the-kind-of-games-we-play).

We meet **on the fourth Saturday of every month** at the Shrub Zero Waste Hub on 22 Bread Street, Edinburgh EH3 9AF.

## The Admin Team

Edinburgh Indie Gamers is run by a small group of volunteers who comprise its admin team.
There are about seven to ten of us who share the responsibility of managing the Club's money, venue bookings, and events.
We also moderate the Discord, maintain the website, and promote the club at conventions or events.
Members of the Admin Team also respond to any feedback, concerns, queries, or issues participants may have.
We do our best to help participants in the club enjoy their time here.

## The Zine

Our zine is also published by volunteers and a wide range of contributors within the Club.
You can find more information about it in [the Zine](zine/index.md) section of the website.

There is no barrier to contribution, and we encourage any member of our community who is interested in sharing any kind of material, whether it is artwork, articles, games, or even contributing their skills with graphic design or copy editing, to get in touch!

## Getting Involved

We always welcome people who want to get involved in running the Club or publishing the Zine!
There is no formal application process.
If you are interested in volunteering, please get in touch with the Admin Team via the [Contact](contact/index.md) page.
